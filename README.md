# Sales and Finance Analytics with Excel

Hey there! Welcome to my Excel-powered data adventure. This project is all about diving into the world of sales and finance analytics—armed with nothing but Excel, some creativity, and a lot of coffee. Let’s see how I turned raw data into meaningful insights that could help businesses make smarter decisions, improve sales, and stay on top of their financial game.

## Sales Report

### What I Did:
1. **Customer Performance Analysis**  
   I whipped up a detailed report to analyze customer performance and sales contributions. Curious? Check it out [here](https://github.com/Trishul-Krishna/Excel-Sales-and-Finance-Analytics-Project-of-AtliQ-Hardwares/blob/main/Customer%20Netsales%20Sales%20Performance%20Report.pdf).
   
2. **Sales vs. Market Performance**  
   Who’s winning—your sales team or the market? I created a side-by-side comparison to find out. Grab the report [here](https://github.com/Trishul-Krishna/Excel-Sales-and-Finance-Analytics-Project-of-AtliQ-Hardwares/blob/main/Market%20Performance%20Report.pdf).

### Why Bother with Sales Analytics?
Well, who wouldn’t want to see how their sales team is really doing? With some Excel magic, I made it super easy to monitor trends, track KPIs, and find those sweet spots to boost sales performance.

### The Cool Stuff I Found:
- Nailed down the perfect discount strategy to keep customers happy while boosting sales.
- Armed the sales team with data-backed ammo for better client negotiations.
- Discovered some promising markets ready for expansion (you’re welcome!).

## Finance Report

### What I Did:
1. **P&L Reports by Fiscal Year**  
   Because every company loves to know if they’re actually making money, right? Check out my fiscal year P&L report [here](https://github.com/Trishul-Krishna/Excel-Sales-and-Finance-Analytics-Project-of-AtliQ-Hardwares/blob/main/P%20%26%20L%20Statements%20By%20Fiscal%20Year.pdf).
   
2. **P&L Reports by Market**  
   Markets aren’t created equal—so I broke down profitability by market. Here’s the report if you’re curious: [P&L by Market](https://github.com/Trishul-Krishna/Excel-Sales-and-Finance-Analytics-Project-of-AtliQ-Hardwares/blob/main/P%20%26%20L%20Statements%20By%20Market.pdf).

### Why Finance Analytics Rocks:
Because money talks! Analyzing financial data gives you a solid foundation for budgeting, forecasting, and making decisions that can keep your business financially healthy (and keep your boss happy).

### The Cool Stuff I Found:
- Aligned financial plans with the company’s big-picture goals.
- Delivered financial insights so clear that even non-financial folks could follow along (no jargon, just the good stuff).

## Excel Skills I Flexed 

- **Excel Wizardry:**  
   You bet I used pivot tables, dynamic reports, and the full Excel toolbox to make this happen. I’m all about those formulas and functions!

- **Data Cleaning Ninja:**  
   No messy data here. I cleaned, organized, and transformed raw numbers into useful information that makes sense (and looks pretty good too).

- **Visualization & Reporting Guru:**  
   From charts to dashboards, I made sure the data told a clear story—because who doesn’t love a good visual?

- **Sales & Finance Pro:**  
   Whether it’s calculating KPIs or crunching P&L numbers, I’ve got Excel’s back for all things sales and finance-related.

## Soft Skills (Because They Matter Too)

- **Analytical Mindset:**  
   I don’t just look at the data—I *think* about it. What’s going on? What’s driving those numbers? I’m all about finding the insights that matter.

- **Detail-Oriented (in a Healthy Way):**  
   Yep, I’ve got that eagle eye. Every report is accurate, clear, and exactly what the business needs.

- **Report Design That Doesn’t Make You Snooze:**  
   I made sure my reports were easy to read and even a little fun (if Excel can be fun!). You’ll get the insights you need without falling asleep halfway through.

- **Time Management Mastery:**  
   Managed deadlines like a pro. Because what’s an analyst without a well-organized schedule?

This project was done using 100% Excel magic (okay, maybe a little bit of elbow grease too). If you’re looking for someone who knows their way around data, can analyze sales and finance like a boss, and make Excel sing—well, here I am!
